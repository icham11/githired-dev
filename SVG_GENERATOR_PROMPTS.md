## 📝 Implementation Notes

### For Frontend Integration:

```html
<!-- Inline SVG -->
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" class="icon icon-interview">
  <!-- SVG content -->
</svg>

<!-- SVG as Image -->
<img src="icons/interview.svg" alt="Interview Practice" class="icon" />

<!-- SVG Component (React) -->
<InterviewIcon className="h-16 w-16" />
```

### Tailwind CSS Styling:

```css
.icon {
  @apply h-16 w-16 text-blue-500;

  animation: pulse 2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1) infinite;
}
```

## 🎬 Animation Recommendations

For interactive SVGs:

```

- Success animations: checkmark draw animation
- Transitions: 300-500ms ease-in-out
- Avoid: overly complex animations on page load
```
